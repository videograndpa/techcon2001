<P><B><FONT COLOR="dd0000">Hotel Reservations:</FONT></B><BR>As important as your <b>conference registration</b> is your <b>hotel reservation</b>.  If you're planning to come to the conference but haven't yet booked a hotel in Las Vegas, you'll find that there's not a lot of choice in NAB hotels (i.e. the ones with bus transportation to and from the Convention Center) with rooms through the entire period. <b>As of 02/26, the PBS block of rooms at the Alexis Park is full !!</b><p> You can work with <a href="http://www.expobook.com/nab2k1/index.cfm"><b>NAB HOUSING 2001</b></a> to find out what is still available (but going fast) in their participating hotels.  You can also contact <a href="http://lasvegas.hotelguide.net/"><b>reservation sites</b></a> (<i>this is only one of <b>many</b></i>), or the individual hotels directly ( see <a href="images/map23.gif"><b>map23</b></a> ) , via the internet, as practically all of them have websites now.  Rates do vary substantially from published NAB prices, and will change -- always higher -- as we get closer to the Conference dates.   <p> You may find your best bet is a hotel <i>off</i> "the strip", as they often fill slower,  have lower rates, and are generally quieter. . . but you will need to provide your own transportation -- cab or rental car.  The AmeriSuites, Hard Rock and St.Tropez are a few of the "off-strip" hotels, near the Alexis Park, where you might avoid transportation problems. <br> <b> Act fast !  -- There's no need to wait until you register for the conference.</b><P>Attendees should note that we're providing most information in downloadable, <B>Adobe Acrobat</B> format.  You should have <A  HREF="http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html" TARGET="body"><B>Acrobat Reader, version 4.0</B></A> or later, installed on your computer, to properly display and print these documents.<P><HR WIDTH="65%" ALIGN=CENTER>

Conference rooms are being reserved at the Las Vegas Hilton.  Workshop commitments from iBiquity and Harris experts will be focused on public radio's unique needs and interests.<P>General  topics to be covered will include:<UL type="disc"><LI>Transmission Chain Technical Issues	<LI>Digital Dollars - Transition Costs and Funding Sources<LI>Datastream Scalability - Channel Options during Transition and Beyond<LI>Signal Quality (transparency and interference impact)<LI>Distribution Operation and Planning</UL>There is a <B>$150</B> registration fee to cover sessions, box lunches on Friday and Saturday, as well as workshop materials.  Additionally, we are planning a reception for attendees on Friday night, and on Saturday night we have the opportunity to confab with our PBS Engineering colleagues.  <p>There are four updates to the preliminary agenda sent out on February 9th:<ul type="disc"><li>iBiquity Digital has offered to include all stations participating in the workshops in their EASE (Early Adopters Station Enchancement) project.  This activity involves filling out an equipment survey, to be
returned by the end of March, that will generate a customized report assessing your station's readiness to add IBOC transmissions (assuming a standard is endorsed by the NRSC and FCC).  Jan Andrews will be e-mailing
these forms to workshop registrants shortly.<li>For those interested, iBiquity has also offered to let workshop attendees have first crack at the mobile demonstration sign-up that will run throughout the NAB convention.<li>Sascom has agreed to host a Saturady morning early bird demonstration of HDA's AudioCube, an impressive audio restoration workstation that has taken NPR's most critical audio engineers by storm.<li>Mark Durenberger, former Director of Technical Operations for the CBS Midwest Teleport in Minneapolis will be our dinner speaker on Friday night.  Rumor has it that the always popular doorprizes may be in the works courtesy of Bud Aiello.  Jim McEachern is coordinating the Saturday night soiree with our PBS Engineering colleagues, and we is also working on continuing the Monday night public radio reception for all of our public radio colleagues.<li>peical thanks to Studer for sponsoring the engineering dinner on Friday night, to Wenger Corporation for sponsoring both days of workshop luncheons, to Jan Andrews for shepherding the conference agenda, to
Cynthia Jones for handling registration, and to all of you for encouraging this long overdue event to take shape.  Last, but hardly least, I'd be remiss if I failed to note how supportive Kevin Klose and Ken Stern have been about the importance of trying out this experiment.</ul>Mike Starling<br>VP, Engineering<br>NPR
