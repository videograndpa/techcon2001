<A NAME="general"></A><P><TABLE WIDTH="640" BORDER="0"><TR><TD><font face="arial"><FONT SIZE="3"><B>General Information:</B></FONT><HR COLOR="ff0000" WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="-1"><FONT SIZE=3><I><B>Thank you !</B></I></FONT><P> . . . Over forty of you so far . . .for your agreement to participate in the <B>PBS Technology Conference, April 20-22, in Las Vegas, Nevada</B>, either as an individual, part of a panel, or a session moderator.  John Tollefson in Engineering and Michael Hunt in Information Technology have worked hard assembling a fine group of speakers.  Now it's my turn to turn planning into reality.<P>If you've had no previous association with the conference, by way of background, this is THE annual event for engineering and information technology personnel from the nation's public television stations, attracting over 400 registered station attendees this year including more top station executives than ever before.  We cover a broad range of topics in both plenary and concurrent sessions.  Conference attendees are highly technically oriented and the presentations range far afield on technical topics.  We do our best, and trust you will do your best, to avoid sales pitches.  Though the market may be down, at the Technology Conference, technology rules! <P>You are part of a distinguished group of speakers.  The conference regularly attracts senior presenters from manufacturing and research companies such as Microsoft, Motorola Broadband, Lucent and Sarnoff Laboratories, as well as industry leaders from such organizations as ATSC, NAB, and CEA.  I've attached a complete speaker's list for this year's conference for your information.  I think you'll agree that you are part of an impressive group.  (I certainly didn't mean to slight any of you in listing just a few of you above!) <P>For more complete information on the conference, including the agenda and our entire schedule of activities, I would direct you to our <I><B>"public"</B></I> <A HREF="index.html"><B>web site</B></A>.   Click on the <A HREF="agenda1.html"><B>Meeting Rooms</B></A> link and you'll be able to see and download the agenda.  Surf the rest of the site for information on the <A HREF="alexis2k1.html"><B>conference hotel</B></A> as well as to see our complete three day schedule of <A HREF="events1.html"><B>social activities</B></A>.  If you'd like to attend or participate in more of the conference and you haven't already registered, we'd be delighted to have you join us any time on the day of your presentation, including lunch.  If you're interested in other days, or the evening events, we'll be glad to register you at reduced rates.  Just let me know.<P><P></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>

<A NAME="hotel"></A><P><TABLE WIDTH="640" BORDER="0"><TR><TD><font face="arial"><FONT SIZE="3"><B>The Location:</B></FONT><HR COLOR="ff0000" WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="-1">For you as speakers, I guess the first thing I should do is make sure you know where we'll be, both for purposes of showing up at the right place and any shipping you have to do.  The conference will be at the:<FONT SIZE=3><CENTER><P><B>Alexis Park Resort Hotel</B><BR>375 East Harmon Avenue<BR>Las Vegas NV 89109<P>Phone:  (702) 796-3300<BR>Fax:  (702) 796-0766<P></CENTER></FONT>The PBS conference will be in two locations, within the hotel.  Plenary sessions as well as the Engineering breakout sessions will be in the Apollo Ballroom, with conference registration for all attendees, including speakers, in the Apollo Foyer.  You need to go their first in order to pick up your nametag and other conference materials.  It's also the best place to meet your panel moderator, PBS host, or anyone else with whom you need to make contact. (I'm there most of the time myself.)  If you are speaking in an Information Technology breakout session, which will be held in Athena, you should nonetheless come to the Apollo Foyer to register.  There's a hotel map in the pdf version of the conference agenda at the web site.  <P>You'll definitely want to download the agenda but for quick reference, the entrances to Athena, the Apollo Foyer and Ballroom are directly from the street, to the right of the main entrance to the hotel lobby.  You do not need to enter the hotel lobby.  The PBS Technology Conference will be well marked with signs.  <B><I>Please plan to arrive at least one hour before your presentation if at all possible.</I></B><P><P></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>

<A NAME="present"></A><P><TABLE WIDTH="640" BORDER="0"><TR><TD><font face="arial"><FONT SIZE="3"><B>Presentations:</B></FONT><HR COLOR="ff0000" WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="-1">Let's talk about you and your presentation. After you've printed that attached Speaker List, please take a  minute to find yourself on it, and email me (rschuetz@pbs.org) any corrections or additions to your title, address, phone, email etc. If you're the moderator of a panel, and I don't know your panelist yet, please get me all the necessary information on them as well.  (Or give me the name and phone number, at least, and I'll do the rest.)<P>On the <A HREF="biopage1.html"><B>Speaker List</B></A>, please also note your session title.  In some cases it may be just a working title.  If that's the case, please let me know the actual session title you'll be using, or at least what you'd like in the web and printed agendas even if you wind up changing it later.  Whether you're keeping the current title or changing it, please also provide me with a one paragraph description of your presentation for the printed program.  (If you're part of a panel the moderator will take care of those tasks.)<P>Whether you're an individual presenter or part of a panel, we also need a short biographical piece for purposes of speaker introductions and our <a href="biopage1.html"><b>web site</b></a>. If you have a photo preference, please provide a small digital image, at least 150x100 pixels, in TIF, TGA or JPG format.  Otherwise, we will take phots during the conference and include one on each web-bio. (<i>see <a href="bio_caleca2k1.html"><b>Ed Caleca</b></a>, as an example of our bio 'style'</i>)<p> No matter how long you make it, we're going to keep all spoken introductions to a minute or less, so it helps us if you can send something that doesn't require lots of editing.  Keynote Speakers are the exception.  While your introductions will also be short  (leaving more time for you) we'd like to include a longer bio in the conference program and on the web. Anything up to a page is fine.<P>Now here are a few points regarding your presentation itself.  Individual speakers or panelists who are making PowerPoint presentations are requested to provide those presentations, via email,  to <a href="mailto:rschuetz@pbs.org"><b>Ralph Schuetz</b></a>.   Please also address a copy to <a href="mailto:swinokur@pbs.org"><b>Stuart Winokur</b></a>, our network and presentation specialist for the Conference.  With your permission, <b><i>which will be assumed unless you advise otherwise</i></b>, PBS will print them (generally 3-up) and have them available to attendees at conference registration. Further, following the conference, we would like to post your presentation to our web site as presentations and/or pdf files.  Again, we will assume your permission for the web posting unless you advise otherwise.<P>The deadline for PowerPoint material to be provided to me in order to allow time for printing is Monday, April 9.  That's only two weeks away.  Please do everything you can to get me your presentation by that date, and sooner is better.  Any presentations not received by that time will not be printed.  Nonetheless, you should still email Stuart and me your PowerPoint presentation so we have it for loading on our computers in advance of the conference.  The absolute deadline for that is one week later, Monday April 16.<P>Speaking of our computers, as noted just above we'll have your presentation loaded on ours if you get it to us in time, and we prefer that approach.  If you must use your own lap-top, as well as for purposes of backup to our system, we are prepared to deal with it.  Incidentally, we assume PowerPoint presentations in all cases.  We can not use either slides or overheads.  If you need any other A/V support I need to know of those requirements immediately.

<A NAME="market"></A><P><TABLE WIDTH="640" BORDER="0"><TR><TD><font face="arial"><FONT SIZE="3"><B>Non-Presentation Material:</B></FONT><HR COLOR="ff0000" WIDTH="80%" ALIGN="left"><FONT SIZE="-1">In the way of marketing, you are invited to provide a limited amount of other print material directly from your company for all registrants, or more specifically for the smaller subset of Information Technology professionals where appropriate.  The registration list is now about 350 station engineers and IT professionals, 50 PBS staff, and 100 speakers and sponsors who will pass through the registration area.  Not everyone takes one of everything on the registration table.  You should provide approximately 300-350 copies to make sure anyone who wants the material can take it..  If your information is specifically for station and PBS staff whose interests are primarily in Information Technology, and your material is to be distributed within the IT breakout room, you should provide at least 150 copies.  This is only our second year of doing concurrent sessions and it's hard for us to predict how many traditional engineers will wander to the IT area for a specific topic or two but these numbers are a good guess. <P>When shipping materials to the hotel, use the address noted earlier in this message and label the material to my attention as well as "Hold for PBS Technology Conference April 20-22"  All materials should be shipped to arrive no earlier than Monday, April 16 and no later than Wednesday, April 18.  Finally, if you're shipping materials to the hotel, please let me know so we can be looking for it when we're setting things up the day before the conference.

So, if you've got any unanswered questions don't hesitate to call. I'll be waiting eagerly for those emails with your personal, biographical, and presentation information, followed by your PowerPoint materials in the next ten days.  Then I'll be looking forward to seeing you in Las Vegas.<p>
