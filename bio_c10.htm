<font size=-1>Telecommunications Project Manager, KWSU/KTNW, Washington State University
<BR><BR CLEAR="left"><P>Tom has worked in the broadcasting industry for the past 15 years. He, like many of us, started in the trenches as an entry-level maintenance technician. Now, working as a Telecommunications Project Manager at Washington State University for the Educational Telecommunications and Technology department, Tom has been part of the central design team for several master control redesigns of the University's two PBS member stations. In 1991 Tom was instrumental in the design project which consolidated and automated operations for KTNW and KWSU. In 1998 after the integrator for the stations' digital conversion project filed for bankruptcy during system design phase, Tom took over the project and served as the systems integrator. That project converted 70% of on-air operations to digital and included the addition of servers, nearline storage, non-linear editing, and an upgraded automation system. <p>Tom is presently Project Manager for the Advanced Digital Distribution Entity Project (or ADDE) funded by CPB as a result of a project request by Dennis Haarsager, general Manager KWSU/KTNW. Tom is responsible for the design and refinement of the ADDE concept and the resulting facilities. He works closely with the top engineers from all the Northwest PBS member stations to design the system which integrates with current station plans, and allows a clear and logical migration path to a consolidated facility. He coordinates with engineers from PBS and with other national projects such as the DTV-Advanced Traffic Project, Digital Asset Management, and the Next Generation Interconnection Committee in order to insure the ADDE project design remains consistent and compatible with the other developing systems.<p>He holds a BS degree in Industrial Education, 1981 University of Wisconsin, Stout; and a BA in Communications Broadcasting, 1986 Washington State University.
